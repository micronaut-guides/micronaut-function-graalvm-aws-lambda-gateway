We'll be keeping it simple and creating a controller to find all the prime numbers less than N,
using the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes[Sieve of Eratosthenes].

To do this, we'll be using the `aws-api-gateway-graal` feature starter of a standard Micronaut App,
which scaffolds a lot of what we need to deploy an AWS Lambda in a custom runtime with API Gateway triggers.

Use the following command to create our app:

`mn create-app example.micronaut.prime-finder --features aws-api-gateway-graal`
