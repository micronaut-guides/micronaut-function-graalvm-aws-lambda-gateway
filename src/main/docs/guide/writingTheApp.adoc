We'll be re-implementing the VAT validator of the previous guide, but as a controller instead of a fuction.

That means we'll be using the `aws-api-gateway-graal` feature starter of a standard Micronaut App.

Use the following command to create our app:

`mn create-app example.micronaut.vat-validator-graal --features aws-api-gateway-graal`
