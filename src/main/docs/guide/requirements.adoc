### You will also want the following:

- An AWS Account https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/create-and-activate-aws-account/[(here's how to start one)]
- A local install of https://docs.docker.com/v17.09/engine/installation/[docker], which is used to build the lambda
- The Micronaut CLI tool, installed via

`sdk install micronaut`

(https://sdkman.io/install[Here's a link to install sdkman if you don't already have it])

### You may also, optionally, want
- The AWS https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install.html[SAM CLI tool], to test deploying the Lambda architecture locally (so there's no surprises in AWS proper!)
- The https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html[AWS CLI tool], which can be used to deploy your entire architecture from the command line
