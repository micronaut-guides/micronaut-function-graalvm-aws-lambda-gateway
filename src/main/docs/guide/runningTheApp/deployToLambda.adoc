Now it's time to try things out in AWS!

NOTE: We've included a `deploy.sh` file that takes care of all of the lambda deployment, if you'd prefer that to the web-based AWS Console.

First we need to build the `zip` file that comprises our AWS Lambda custom runtime
(if you followed along with the previous section, you can skip this as `sam-local.sh` already did it for you).

[source,java]
.Building the Function.zip deployable
----
  docker build . -t prime-finder
  mkdir -p build
  docker run --rm --entrypoint cat prime-finder  /home/application/function.zip > build/function.zip
----

Now we'll want to navigate to https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/home and click `Create function`

We'll be prompted for some inputs, so fill out the "Function name" as "prime-finder" and choose the "Runtime" to be
"Custom runtime -> Provide your own bootstrap" under

Now under "Permissions" at the bottom, we'll need to create a new lambda execution role. AWS can take care of this for you,
just select the first radio button!

You should be brought to a new page to finish configuring the detail of your new "prime-finder" lambda.

Next we need to upload the `function.zip` file that docker placed in our `build/` directory using the "Code entry type" dropdown.

Finally, we have to click "Save" up in the top right, and wait for the zip to finish uploading,
which may take 20-30 seconds.

And we have our lambda! Clicking "Test" on this page isn't going to do much of anything, as we still need the second piece of the puzzle.
