Now it's time to try things out in AWS!

NOTE: We've included a `deploy.sh` file that takes care of all of the following, if you'd prefer that to the web-based AWS Console.

First we need to build the `zip` file that comprises our AWS Lambda custom runtime
(if you followed along with the previous section, you can skip this as `sam-local.sh` already did it for you).

[source,java]
.Building the Function.zip deployable
----
  docker build . -t prime-finder
  mkdir -p build
  docker run --rm --entrypoint cat prime-finder  /home/application/function.zip > build/function.zip
----

Now we'll want to navigate to https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/home and click `Create function`
