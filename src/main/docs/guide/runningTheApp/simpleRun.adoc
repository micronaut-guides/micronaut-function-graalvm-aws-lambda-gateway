For starters, it's worth pointing out briefly that at the core, this is just like any other
Micronaut app you might build. To test changes in functionality quickly and locally, we can run
`./gradlew run` just like an app built without the `--features aws-api-gateway-graal`.

Take this opportunity quickly to ensure you've been following along successfully and start the app.

`./gradlew run`

Then, try out a few `curl` commands (or whichever http client you like to test APIs best)!

`$ curl localhost:8080/find-primes-below/999`
