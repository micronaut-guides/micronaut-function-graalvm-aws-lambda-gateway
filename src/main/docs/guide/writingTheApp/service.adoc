Just as any other Micronaut app, we'll want to isolate the "business logic"  of how we compute
the prime numbers to a service.

As we mentioned previously, the most efficient algorithm to calculate the primes below a given
number N is the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes[Sieve of Eratosthenes], which
steps up from 2 to N and tosses out all the multiples of the given step, so that subsequent passes
are working with only the leftover numbers on the next pass.

See below for an adaption of
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sieve-eratosthenes-0n-time-complexity/[this O(n) java implementation of the algorithm]
