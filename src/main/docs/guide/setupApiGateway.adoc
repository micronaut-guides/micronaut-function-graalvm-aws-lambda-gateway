Let's get our Lambda an API Gateway trigger!

Navigate to https://console.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/home and click on the "Get Started" button in the middle of the screen.
If you've created an API Gateway in the past, you'll instead need to click "Create API" in the top right.

You'll be presented with an Example API, but we want to create our own. Select the "New API" radio and give the API a name, then click "Create API"

Now that we have our API, we need to create a catch-all "proxy" resource for our Lambda (we want our Micronaut app to handle routing).

Use the "Actions" dropdown and select "Create Resource"

Checking the "Configure as proxy resource" checkbox will automatically fill in the name and path, then we just need to click "Create Resource"

Next we need to connect this API to our lambda.

"Lambda Function Proxy" should already be selected, so just start typing our lambda's name in the in the
"Lambda Function" autocomplete box and select it once it pops up. Then click "Save"

At this point, we can use the AWS console to test out triggering our API, using the "Test" button on the left hand side of
resource visualization.

As our app is expecting `GET` requests at `/find-primes-below/{number}`, that's how we'll fill in the test details.

You should receive a 200 response with the list of primes.

NOTE: If you get an error, check the "Path" input box to ensure it matches the path of your controller method, and check
the Lambda config to ensure the function zip uploaded successfully.

We're almost to the finish line now! We've confirmed that everything works properly, but our API is not yet publicly accessible.

To make that happen, we need to "Deploy" our API. From the "Actions" dropdown, select "Deploy API"

APIs can be deployed in "Stages". Commonly you might have a "test" and "prod" stage where changes would naturally propagate,
but for the purposes of this guide we'll just create one new stage called "demo".

Click "Deploy", and we should get the URL for our newly deployed API!

Now we can use any API client we like to test our new url.

Congratulations! You've got yourself your first Micronaut GraalVM API with AWS!
